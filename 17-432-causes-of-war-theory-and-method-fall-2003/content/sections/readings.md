New York, NY: Basic Books, 2003, pp. 41-60. ISBN: 9780465068623.  {{< br >}}The advance of science has a horrendous byproduct: we are discovering ever more powerful means of destruction. These destructive powers are being democratized, says Rees: the mayhem that only major states can do today may lie within the capacity of millions of individuals in the future unless we somehow change course. Deterrence works against states but will fail against crazed non-state organizations or individuals. Hence the pacifying effects that WMD have so far produced will be reversed as humans invent more potent means of mass destruction. What will result? A vast outbreak of preventive wars of counter-proliferation? What can be done to address this danger? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

"They lie there like dry tinder, and any spark could set them ablaze" (p. 164). Cox urges that we work to identify the factors that tempt people to use their scripture to justify hatred and brutality. Do we need more work on this subject?

ISBN: 9780375508592.  {{< br >}}Pages 38-55, 62-68, 91-94 describe the Islamist currents of thinking that spawned Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda's violence stems from a stream of Islamist thought going back to ibn Taymiyya, a bellicose Islamic thinker from the 13th century; to Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792), the harsh and rigid shaper of modern Saudi Arabian Islam; to Rashid Rida (1866-1935) and Hassan al-Banna (?-1949); and above all to Sayyid Qutb (?-1966), the shaper of modern Islamism. Taymiyya, al-Wahhab and Qutb are covered here. Covered also (pp. 91-94) is the frightening rise of apocalyptic thinking in the Islamic world. What causes the murderous thinking described here?  {{< br >}}Pages 419-446 cover the phenomenon of millenarianism--apocalyptic thinking--in other religions--Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity.

In the past many political science departments defined "methodology" to consist solely of large-n (statistical) methods. While statistics was a required course at most schools, case study methodology often wasn't even taught. This is changing, as these syllabi illustrate. I include them for your general perusal and background. No need to give them a talmudic reading--they are for your reference. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Those curious to see more qualitative methods syllabi can find them on the web at [Syllabi](http://www.asu.edu/clas/polisci/cqrm/syllabi.html).

Clearly, the effects of depressions on modern industrial politics are not uniform; instead, a condition variable of some sort must decide these effects. Clearly, that condition variable must have had very different values in the Swedish and German cases. Berman's study tries to identify that condition variable.
